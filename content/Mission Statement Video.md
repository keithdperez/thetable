We aim to create a video that conveys our identity as a Jesus-centered community, deeply committed to the wellbeing of others and practicing radical hospitality, all for God's glory. This will give context as to who we are, what we do, and will serve as a great reference on YouTube, our website and other locations.

## Inspiration
- [Diversity Church mission statement video](https://youtu.be/6R3tcd1tac0)

## Key Script Points
- "We are a Jesus-centered community, irrationally committed to the wellbeing of others and living in radical hospitality - All to God's glory and for His purposes."
- We live this out daily within our community and those around us.
- Our town is bustling with events, and we aim to provide hospitality, opening our doors to show Jesus' love.
- We demonstrate our love for each other as Jesus taught, making it clear to others that we are His disciples.
- We enjoy worshiping God through song, sharing meals, engaging in discussions, and gathering in homes and our beautiful building.
