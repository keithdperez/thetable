**Good morning, everyone! Welcome to The Table!**

I have a couple of important announcements for you this morning:

### Guatemala
We believe in supporting missions at The Table, both locally and globally. We have a special connection with a remote village in Guatemala, where we help provide for their needs. Currently, we sponsor 16 children in this village. We have 4 sponsorships available, and 1 has already been taken, so we have 3 more opportunities for sponsorship.

If anyone is interested in sponsoring a child or wants more details, please talk to Ericson, and we will provide you with more information!

### MIDBAR Event
First, we are thrilled to announce that MIDBAR is happening this Saturday, July 20th, from 6 PM to 8 PM. The word "Midbar" is Hebrew for "wilderness." It's in the wilderness where we often find ourselves stripped of distractions and comforts, and it's there we can truly seek and see God's face. Just like in the Bible, where Moses encountered God in the wilderness and Jesus went into the wilderness to pray and be with the Father, we believe that in our own wilderness experiences, we can draw closer to God.

### No Service Next Sunday
Next, please take note that we will NOT be having our regular service here next Sunday morning. Make sure to mark your calendars! If you show up, you’ll find the doors closed and a quiet parking lot. This has also been noted in our weekly email, so double-check there for more details.

### Introducing Tobin
Now, I have the pleasure of introducing a dear friend of mine, Tobin. Tobin is a man passionately pursuing God, and his journey is inspiring. From a young age, he and his two brothers embarked on a musical adventure. Picture this: Tobin hands drumsticks to one brother, a bass guitar to the other, and declares, "We're starting a band!" That band, formed back in the year 2000, grew into Flatfoot 56, a Celtic punk band that has had the privilege of playing to audiences all over the world – from Europe to Tokyo, and across the US.

Today, Tobin lives near his hometown, midway in Chicago, with his wonderful wife Vanessa, who you saw singing with us today, and their beautiful daughter Edith, affectionately known as Edie.

Please join me in giving a warm and honorable welcome to our friend Tobin!
