### Overview:
We've been facing some challenges with our current livestream setup at The Table, which have impacted the quality of our broadcasts. To improve our livestream experience and make it more reliable, I suggest we upgrade our equipment. Below, I've outlined the issues with our current setup, two alternative solutions, and my recommendation for the best option moving forward.

## Current Setup and Issues

**Current Equipment:**
- [**Mac mini M1**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111894) (overloaded with 3 displays)
  - Display for computer operator
  - Splitter for 2 stage TVs
  - [DisplayLink adapter](https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-HDMI-External-Video-Adapter/dp/B00O6G5ZGI/ref=sr_1_32?crid=31NBAEGDQ5BL1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kOq7iS70QFi-57VrnWXjk4d_c_-WZnEEKJVX97CqvUXEso7OJXRP8GfdWuCYPyCJPuPju9fQAa7d3Lvhpl-XQLnRDlJSN69dd_3EkD7y5_Y.TB-rI4l4oabg7fl_TxQf0DyB4u-pR9vPtAiUojd67oA&dib_tag=se&keywords=displaylink%2Badapter&qid=1721911596&s=electronics&sprefix=displaylink%2Celectronics%2C119&sr=1-32&th=1) for confidence monitor
- **USB devices:**
  - DMX lights control
  - Scarlett 2i2 audio interface
  - Elgato Streamdeck
  - Elgato CamLink 4K for PTZ camera

**Issues:**
- **ProPresenter** experiencing audio dropouts and occasional crashes
- USB bandwidth overloaded due to high demand on Mac mini M1

## Option 1: Sonnet Chassis with Blackmagic DeckLink Duo Card

This is the routing that most churches use in their ProPresenter setup, and it's recommended by Renewed Vision, ProPresenter's company/creator. [Watch their recommendation here.](https://youtu.be/y58_OaynoMc)

[(List of equipment can be found here.)](https://www.bnh.com/wish/6ef3a0c878d3f2d68856ef070d988518/)

**Benefits:**
- **Stability**: SDI provides a more stable video feed.
- **Resource Management**: Offloads video processing, freeing up Mac mini resources.
- **Scalability**: Modular setup allows for future upgrades and more screen outputs around the building.
- **Flexibility**: Should work with various computers.

**Considerations:**
- Additional cost for chassis and DeckLink card.
- The computer and software plugged in would need to recognize the DeckLink capture card through a specific driver.

### **Total Cost**: Approx. $1,200

## Option 2: Mac mini Pro with M2 Chip

Recently released, the new Mac mini M2 Pro [now handles 3 native displays.](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/specs/) Up until now, this was a limitation in the past for churches, especially when running 3 display outputs, as the Mac mini was limited to 2. Now, this opens up possibilities to keep what we have, as well as better USB bandwidth.

[(Equipment can be found here)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746367-REG/apple_mnh73ll_a_mac_mini_with_m2.html)

**Benefits:**
- **Power**: M2 chip handles more tasks and supports up to 3 displays natively.
- **Simplicity**: Reduces need for a DisplayLink adapter and simplifies the setup.
- **Future-Proofing**: More Thunderbolt ports and overall performance improvements.

**Considerations:**
- Higher initial cost.
- HDMI setup remains, but it's at its limit for adding more to the setup, good for powering the main level setup.
- Future expansion: For displaying around the rest of the building, alternatives like casting from YouTube or a splitter upgrade can be considered.

**Note**: We would trade in our current Mac mini M1 computer and put the money towards the cost of the new Mac mini, making this option more affordable compared to Option 1.

### **Total Cost**: Approx. $1,200 (+ the trade-in value of Mac mini M1)

## Recommendation

I recommend **Option 2: Mac mini Pro with M2 Chip**. This solution simplifies our setup, enhances performance, and prepares us for future technological needs. The benefits of a more powerful system outweigh the higher initial cost, and it addresses all current issues effectively.
