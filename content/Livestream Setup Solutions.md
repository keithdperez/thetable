### Current Setup Issues:
- **ProPresenter**: Receiving video from Tongveo PTZ camera via Elgato CamLink 4K to Mac mini M1.
- **Problems**: Audio dropouts and occasional crashes.
- **Automation**: Uses ProPresenter's calendar feature to schedule and manage livestream events.

### Alternative Setup 1:  (approx. $1,200)
#### Equipment:
- **Sonnet Chassis with Blackmagic DeckLink Duo Card**: 
  - **Benefits**: 
    - Switch to SDI for more stable video feed.
    - Can send video to audience and stage screens without overloading Mac mini.
    - Frees up resources on the Mac mini, potentially reducing audio dropouts.
  - **Considerations**:
    - Additional cost for the chassis and DeckLink Duo card.
    - Need to ensure compatibility and proper configuration.

### Alternative Setup 2: (Approx. $1,200)
#### Equipment:
- **Mac mini Pro with M2 Chip**:
  - **Benefits**:
    - Supports up to 3 displays, eliminating the need for a display link adapter.
    - More powerful, reducing the risk of crashes and handling multiple tasks better.
    - 4 Thunderbolt ports for more flexibility.
  - **Considerations**:
    - Higher initial cost for the new Mac mini Pro.
    - Need to migrate existing setup and configurations.

### Recommendation:
Both setups offer significant improvements over the current system. I recommend Option 2 as it not only addresses our current issues but also prepares us for future technological needs.
