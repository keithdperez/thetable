This guide explains how to turn on the necessary equipment and operate ProPresenter for our church services.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the computer and necessary equipment in the booth.
- Knowledge of the password and basic understanding of ProPresenter.

## Steps

### Turning Things On

#### Step 1: Unlock the Computer
- **Action**: Open the lock screen on the computer.
- **Details**: Enter the password. *(Ask a staff member for the password if needed)*
- **Note**: *Do not* open ProPresenter or any other applications yet.

#### Step 2: Turn On the Confidence Monitor TV
- **Action**: Turn on the confidence monitor TV.
- **Details**: The power button is located on the bottom left side of the TV directly behind you.

#### Step 3: Turn On Both Stage Screen TVs
- **Action**: Turn on the stage screen TVs near the stage.
- **Details**: Make sure to press `HDMI 1` to set the correct input.

#### Step 4: Open ProPresenter
- **Action**: Open ProPresenter on the computer.
- **Details**: Ensure all three screens (confidence monitor and two stage screens) are on before opening the application.

### Operating ProPresenter

#### Songs
- **General Rule**: Follow along with the band.
  - **Timing**: Click the slide a little before the current line of lyrics is finished. Ideally, click when singing the last word of the current line.
  - **Spontaneity**: Worship can be spontaneous. If the band jumps to a different part of the song, follow along and know your arrangement spot.
  - **Key Mapping**: All sections of the song (verse, chorus, bridge, tag, etc.) start with a key mapping (a small orange letter on the first slide of the song section). This helps you quickly find your place or jump to a song section if needed.

#### Sermon
- **Timing**: Click through sermon slides differently than worship songs.
  - **Wait**: Itâ€™s best to wait until the pastor or speaker has made their point before clicking the corresponding slide.
  - **Caution**: Do not click early to avoid revealing the point before the speaker does. Wait until you hear the verbal cue.

## Troubleshooting

- **General Settings**: Press `Cmd + ,` to access all settings and click the relevant section.
- **Screen Output Issues**: Press `Cmd + Opt + 1` to open the screen configuration window in ProPresenter.
- **Livestream Issues**: For camera or audio issues, check the "Input" section in settings.
- **Computer Audio**: Adjust the volume using the big "monitor" dial on the [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 interface](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AhLyvWVqL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) next to the computer.
