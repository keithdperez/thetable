This is all on how to use the churchcenter app for The Table.

## Getting started

[Here is the Church Center MAIN PAGE!](https://thetablechurchlemont.churchcenter.com)

Church center is the public-facing app, where congregants can find all info in one central spot that they need. This can change via preference, but can include scheduling, giving, calendar, group involvement, events, directories, sermons (paid function), etc.
