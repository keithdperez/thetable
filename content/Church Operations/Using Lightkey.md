title: Using Lightkey with StreamDeck and ProPresenter
---
#### Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of controlling your church's stage lighting using [Lightkey](https://lightkeyapp.com/en), [StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-mk2-black) (configured via [Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion)), and [ProPresenter](https://renewedvision.com/propresenter/) for a seamless worship experience.

### Requirements:

- Lightkey installed and set up for your lighting system
- StreamDeck device
- Companion software for StreamDeck configuration
- ProPresenter for slide presentations and MIDI cue integration

### Step 1: Open Necessary Programs

Ensure that Lightkey and Companion are both opened on the designated computer. Lightkey controls the lighting, while Companion allows the StreamDeck to communicate with Lightkey.

### Step 2: Check Lightkey Setup

Confirm that all fixtures and lighting scenes in Lightkey are correctly set up and tested. Make sure you're familiar with how Lightkey's interface corresponds to your physical stage setup.

### Step 3: StreamDeck Configuration

1. **Open Companion**: This software lets you configure your StreamDeck to send commands to Lightkey.
2. **Load the Pre-Made Profile**: Import the pre-made StreamDeck profile that's been created for your church. This profile has button configurations that allow you to turn on and off the lights simply.

### Step 4: Using StreamDeck with Lightkey

- Each button on your StreamDeck corresponds to different lighting actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, changing colors).
- Pressing a button on StreamDeck sends a command through Companion to Lightkey, triggering the desired action.
- Familiarize yourself with the button layouts and their respective functions before the service begins.

### Step 5: Integrating ProPresenter for Automated Lighting Cues

1. **Set Up MIDI Cues in ProPresenter**: Sync your songs and slides in ProPresenter with MIDI cues that correspond to specific lighting scenes in Lightkey.
2. **Test the Integration**: Before the service, run a test to ensure that clicking on the first slide of a song in ProPresenter triggers the correct lighting changes in Lightkey.
3. **Running a Service**: During the service, as you progress through the slides in ProPresenter, the lights will automatically change to match the song's mood and theme based on the pre-programmed MIDI cues.

#### Tips for Smooth Operation:

- **Rehearse**: Conduct a full run-through with your tech team before services to ensure everyone is comfortable with the system.
- **Backup Plans**: Always have a backup plan in case of software/hardware failure. This could include manual control instructions for Lightkey or a simplified lighting setup.
- **Continuous Learning**: Encourage the tech team to experiment with Lightkey and StreamDeck during non-service times to become more familiar with the software's capabilities and limitations.

#### Troubleshooting:

- If the lights do not respond as expected, check the connections between ProPresenter, Companion, and Lightkey. Ensure all software is up to date.
- If a specific button on the StreamDeck does not trigger the expected action in Lightkey, verify the button's configuration in Companion.
