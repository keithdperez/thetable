# How to Turn On the Audio System

## Purpose
This guide explains how to turn on the audio system for church services, ensuring all components are set up and ready for use.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the audio booth and stage.
- Knowledge of where the equipment is located.

## Steps

### Step 1: Turn On the Amplifier
- **Action**: Turn on the amplifier located in the booth.
- **Details**: The amplifier is on top of the small wooden pull-out drawer below the desk on the left side, just as you enter. 
  - This will turn on the main house speakers.
  - This enables the computer audio and any stage audio to come through.
  - Note: The Sonos speakers are independent and always on. They can be accessed from the Sonos app, casting from Spotify, etc., as long as you are on the same church Wi-Fi.
- **Expected Outcome**: The main house speakers are powered on and ready for audio input.

### Step 2: Turn On the Stage Monitors
- **Action**: Turn on the stage monitors.
- **Details**: The stage monitors are powered and have their own switches.
  - Locate the switches on each monitor and turn them on.
- **Expected Outcome**: Stage monitors are powered on and ready for audio output.

### Step 3: Prepare the Microphones
- **Action**: Insert batteries into the microphones.
- **Details**: There are 4 Shure PG58 wireless microphones.
  - Prep enough microphones for those singing on any given Sunday.
  - Ensure 2 batteries are prepared for the pastor's headset (which the pastor usually grabs). Make sure to set up a guest speaker if needed.
- **Expected Outcome**: Microphones are powered and ready for use.

### Step 4: Turn On the Instruments
- **Action**: Turn on the instruments.
- **Details**: The drums, keyboard, and bass amp all have power switches.
  - Locate the power switch on each instrument and turn it on.
- **Expected Outcome**: Instruments are powered on and ready for use.

## Running Audio

### Using the Mixing Station App
- **Action**: Control the audio using the Mixing Station app via the iPad located in the booth.
- **Details**: The mixer can be accessed by any device connected to the same Wi-Fi (iPhone, computer, etc.).
- **Expected Outcome**: Audio levels can be managed and adjusted as needed during the service.

## Methodology

### Gain Staging and Levels
- **Action**: Ensure each channel is set to 0db (unity).
- **Details**: Each channel should receive the proper amount of signal (gain stage around -15db).
  - This ensures proper audio levels for the livestream, compression, FX, etc.
- **Expected Outcome**: Proper gain structure and minimal adjustments needed during the service.

### EQ Adjustments
- **Action**: Use low cuts and high cuts for EQ adjustments.
- **Details**: Avoid extreme EQ settings. Aim to blend the instrument into the overall mix while maintaining sound integrity.
- **Expected Outcome**: Balanced and clear audio mix.

## Things to Note

- The Behringer X Air 18 mixer is left on at all times, with all channels *unmuted* (except for the bass channel to avoid low buzz).
  - Turn off the speakers when not in use.
- Computer audio is controlled via the red Scarlett 2i2 interface using the big volume dial to the right of the computer screen.
  - Ensure the main speakers are on.
- Stage monitors are in a LEFT/RIGHT stereo pair.
  - Panning channels can adjust the feed, but proper gain staging should maintain balance.
- In-ears and livestream receive a stereo signal.

## Troubleshooting

- **Using Sonos for Background Music**:
  - Ensure you are on the church's Wi-Fi: `TableChurch102` is the password.
- **Cables and Adapters**:
  - Found in the walk-in closet by the side room (nursery).
