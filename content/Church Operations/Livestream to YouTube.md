Welcome to The Table's Live-Streaming Guide. This document will walk you through the steps to set up and manage our live stream using ProPresenter and YouTube. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth and successful live streaming experience for our Sunday services.

## During the Week Prep

1. **Log in to YouTube Studio**:
   - Open [YouTube Studio for The Table](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCyU7upEfTQI8xVKt1KG1fUQ/livestreaming/manage?c=UCyU7upEfTQI8xVKt1KG1fUQ) and log in with the church’s account.

2. **Schedule a New Live Stream**:
   - Click on the "Create" button and select "Go live."
   - Choose the "Schedule Stream" option and select "Reuse settings" to use the previous settings.
   - Retitle the video with the correct date (the coming Sunday).
   - Click "Next," then click "Next" again, leaving the page the same.
   - In the dropdowns, ensure the date and time reflect the correct date and time of the service (10 AM).
   - Click "Done," and once the page refreshes, you can close that page.
   - Note: ProPresenter will start the stream automatically as the service begins.

## On Sunday

1. **Livestream Auto-start**:
   - The live stream starts automatically using ProPresenter’s Calendar feature, which begins encoding the stream to YouTube at 10 AM.
   - Keep the welcome loop slides going while people arrive.

2. **Transition to the Service**:
   - Once we're about to start, click the first worship slide in ProPresenter.
   - This action will turn on the stage lights and switch the camera to show for the live stream viewers.
   - Be sure to click that slide on time!

3. **End the Live Stream**:
   - Clicking the last dismissal/goodbye slide will automatically end the live stream.
